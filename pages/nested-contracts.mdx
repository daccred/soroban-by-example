# Nested Contracts [Soroban Contract in Contract Authorization]

```rust
// [!include ~/snippets/nested-contracts.rs]
```

## Explanation

`#![no_std]` This attribute prevents linking to the standard library, making the code lighter and more efficient for Soroban contracts. It's big so we save on size.

`use soroban_sdk::{contract, contractimpl, Env, log}` Imports stuffs from the Soroban SDK. `Env` is basic Soroban type, we need it because we can't use the Rust standard library.

`#[contract]` Marks the struct as a Soroban smart contract. Soroban smart contracts are defined as Rust structs.

`#[contractimpl]` Marks the implementation block as containing contract methods and transforms it to code that Soroban can evaluate directly

#### ContractA

-   Calls the `authorized_fn_b` function in `ContractB`.
-   Authorizes itself as the current contract using `authorize_as_current_contract`.
-   The authorization includes a `SubContractInvocation` for `ContractC`. The `SubContractInvocation` structure is used to define the details of a subcontract call. The `SubContractInvocation` specifies the contract address, function name (`authorized_fn_c`), and arguments (the current contract's address).
-   This allows `ContractA` to call `authorized_fn_c` in `ContractC` on behalf of itself.

#### ContractB

-   The `authorized_fn_b` function requires the caller to have authorization.
-   It creates a client for `ContractC` and calls `authorized_fn_c` in `ContractC`, passing the authorizer's address.

#### ContractC

-   The `authorized_fn_c` function requires the caller to have authorization.
-   It simply checks the caller's authorization and doesn't perform any additional actions.
