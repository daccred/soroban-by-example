# Flash Loans [Soroban Flash Loans]

```rust
// [!include ~/snippets/token-erc20.rs]
```

## Explanation

`#![no_std]` This attribute prevents linking to the standard library, making the code lighter and more efficient for Soroban contracts. It's big so we save on size.

`use soroban_sdk::{contract, contractimpl, Env, log}` Imports stuffs from the Soroban SDK. `Env` is basic Soroban type, we need it because we can't use the Rust standard library.

`DAY_IN_LEDGERS`, `INSTANCE_BUMP_AMOUNT`, and `INSTANCE_LIFETIME_THRESHOLD` These constants are related to the storage management of the contract's state. They define how long data should be kept and when it should be refreshed.

`BALANCE_BUMP_AMOUNT` and `BALANCE_LIFETIME_THRESHOLD` These constants are related to the storage management of individual account balances.

`AllowanceDataKey` This represents the key for storing an allowance, including the from address and the spender address.

`AllowanceValue` This represents the value of an allowance, including the `amount` and `expiration_ledger`.

`DataKey` This an enum defining different types of data keys used in the contract, such as allowances, balances, and administrative information.

#### Helper Functions

**Administrator Management** functions check, read, and write the current administrator of the contract.

**Allowance Management** functions read, write, and spend allowances.

**Balance Management** functions read, write, receive, and spend balances.

**Metadata Management** functions read and write the token's decimal places, name, and symbol.

**Amount Validation** function ensure that amounts are non-negative.

#### Token Contract

**Initialization** triggers the contract with an administrator, decimal places, name, and symbol.

**Minting** allows the administrator to mint new tokens and assign them to a specific address.

**Setting Admin** allows the current administrator to transfer administrative privileges to a new address.

**Allowance and Transfer Functions** implement the standard ERC-20 token functions for approving, transferring, and burning tokens.
