# Upgradeable Contract [Soroban Upgradeable Contract]

```rust
// [!include ~/snippets/upgradeable-contract.rs]
```

## Explanation

`#![no_std]` This attribute prevents linking to the standard library, making the code lighter and more efficient for Soroban contracts. It's big so we save on size.

`use soroban_sdk::{contract, contractimpl, Env, log}` Imports stuffs from the Soroban SDK. `Env` is basic Soroban type, we need it because we can't use the Rust standard library.

`DataKey` This is an enumerated type (`enum`) used to define different keys for storing data in the contract's storage. Currently, the only option is `Admin`.

`Error` This is another enumerated type defining a specific error code: `AlreadyInitialized`.

`init` This function checks if the `Admin` key already exists in storage. If it does, it returns the `AlreadyInitialized` error. Otherwise, it sets the `Admin` key with the provided `admin` address and returns success (`Ok(())`).

`upgrade` This retrieves the current administrator address from storage using the Admin key. It then uses `require_auth` (likely from the Soroban SDK) to ensure only the administrator can call this function. Finally, it utilizes the `deployer` functionality from the environment to update the contract's bytecode with the provided `new_wasm_hash`.
