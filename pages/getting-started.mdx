Visit various sections like "Hello World", "Counter App", and "ERC" to see example smart contracts.
Each section provides a code snippet and explanations to help you understand the concepts and implement the functionality.

## Smart Contract Development:

Follow the examples to create your own smart contracts.
Use the provided snippets as templates and modify them according to your needs.

## Soroboy AI

Ask Soroboy AI for assistance directly on the Soroban by Example website.
Soroboy✨ can help generate smart contract code snippets and answer questions about Soroban in a simple and easy-to-understand manner with context of the contract on the page.

## Code Generation

Provide Soroboy with context or specific requirements, and it will generate relevant code snippets for your smart contracts.

Examples:

```rust
#[no_mangle]
#![no_std]
use soroban_sdk::{contract, contractimpl, Env, log};

#[contract]
pub struct HelloWorld;

#[contractimpl]
impl HelloWorld {
    pub fn say_hello(env: Env) {
        log!(&env, "Hello World");
    }
}
```
