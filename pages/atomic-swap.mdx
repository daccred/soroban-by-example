# Atomic Swap [Soroban Atomic Swap]

```rust
// [!include ~/snippets/atomic-swap.rs]
```

## Guide

`#![no_std]` This attribute prevents linking to the standard library, making the code lighter and more efficient for Soroban contracts. It's big so we save on size.

`use soroban_sdk::{contract, contractimpl, Env, log}` Imports stuffs from the Soroban SDK. `Env` is basic Soroban type, we need it because we can't use the Rust standard library.

`#[contract]` Marks the struct as a Soroban smart contract. Soroban smart contracts are defined as Rust structs.

`#[contractimpl]` Marks the implementation block as containing contract methods and transforms it to code that Soroban can evaluate directly.

## Explanation

`swap` This function takes in the following parameters:

-   `env`: The current environment, providing access to contract state and functionality.
-   `a` and `b`: The addresses of the two parties involved in the swap.
-   `token_a` and `token_b`: The addresses of the tokens being exchanged.
-   `amount_a` and `amount_b`: The amounts of each token to be exchanged.
-   `min_b_for_a` and `min_a_for_b`: Minimum acceptable amounts of the other token that each party is willing to receive.

`if amount_b < min_b_for_a { ... }` This checks if the amount of token B being offered is less than the minimum acceptable amount for token A. If so, panics with an error message.

`if amount_a < min_a_for_b { ... }` This performs a similar check as above, but for token A.

`require_auth_for_args(...)` Ensures that the parties a and b have authorized the transaction by providing the correct arguments.

`move_token` This function transfers the tokens through the contract's address to ensure that both parties receive their respective tokens simultaneously.
