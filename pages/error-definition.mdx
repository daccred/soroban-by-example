# Error Definition [Soroban Error Definition]

```rust
// [!include ~/snippets/error-definition.rs]
```

## Guides

`#![no_std]` This attribute prevents linking to the standard library, making the code lighter and more efficient for Soroban contracts. It's big so we save on size.

`use soroban_sdk::{contract, contractimpl, Env, log}` Imports stuffs from the Soroban SDK. `Env` is basic Soroban type, we need it because we can't use the Rust standard library.

`#[contracterror]` This attribute indicates that the error type is specifically designed for contract-related errors. It might trigger additional error handling or logging mechanisms within the contract context.

`#[derive(Copy, Clone, Debug, Eq, PartialEq, PartialOrd, Ord)]` These traits are derived to provide essential functionality for the error type:

-   Copy: Allows the error to be copied efficiently, potentially for logging or reporting purposes.
-   Clone: Enables creating copies of the error, useful for various scenarios like error propagation or handling.
-   Debug: Provides a human-readable representation of the error, aiding in debugging and logging.
-   Eq: Defines equality comparison for the error type, allowing for checking if two errors are the same.
-   PartialEq: Defines partial equality comparison, which might handle cases where the error type has additional fields that don't affect equality.
-   PartialOrd: Defines partial ordering for the error type, allowing for comparisons based on certain criteria.
-   Ord: Defines total ordering for the error type, enabling consistent sorting and comparison.

`#[repr(u32)]` This attribute specifies that the error type should be represented as a 32-bit unsigned integer. This might be useful for efficient storage or transmission of error codes.

`#[contract]` Marks the struct as a Soroban smart contract. Soroban smart contracts are defined as Rust structs.

`#[contractimpl]` Marks the implementation block as containing contract methods and transforms it to code that Soroban can evaluate directly

`pub` Marks a function as external, meaning it can be invoked outside of the context of the contract code itself.

## Explanation

For the `count` value, the `mut` keyword was used to declare it as a mutable variable. Mutable variables can have their values changed after they are initially defined. This allows for more flexibility and dynamic behavior in your Rust code.

In Rust, `Ok` and `Err` are fundamental keywords for handling errors in a robust and type-safe manner. They form the core of Rust's option and result types, which are essential for expressing computations that might fail.
