# Contract Deployment [Soroban Contract Deployment]

```rust
// [!include ~/snippets/contract-deployment.rs]
```

## Explanation

`#![no_std]` This attribute prevents linking to the standard library, making the code lighter and more efficient for Soroban contracts. It's big so we save on size.

`use soroban_sdk::{contract, contractimpl, Env, log}` Imports stuffs from the Soroban SDK. `Env` is basic Soroban type, we need it because we can't use the Rust standard library.

`pub`Â Marks a function as external, meaning it can be invoked outside of the context of the contract code itself.

#### Authorization

If `deployer` is not the current contract, it checks if deployer has the necessary permissions.

#### Deployment

Uses the `deployer`'s address and salt to create a new contract address.

Deploys the Wasm module with the given hash to the new address.

#### Initialization

Invokes the specified initialization function on the deployed contract with the provided arguments.

#### Return (Output)

Returns a tuple containing the address of the deployed contract and the result of the initialization function.
