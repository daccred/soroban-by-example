# Logging [Soroban Logging]

```rust
// [!include ~/snippets/logging.rs]
```

## Guide

`#![no_std]` This attribute prevents linking to the standard library, making the code lighter and more efficient for Soroban contracts. It's big so we save on size.

`use soroban_sdk::{contract, contractimpl, Env, log}`  Imports stuffs from the Soroban SDK. `Env` is basic Soroban type, we need it because we can't use the Rust standard library.

`#[contract]`  Marks the struct as a Soroban smart contract. Soroban smart contracts are defined as Rust structs.

`#[contractimpl]` Marks the implementation block as containing contract methods and transforms it to code that Soroban can evaluate directly

`pub` Marks a function as external, meaning it can be invoked outside of the context of the contract code it
self.

## Explanation

Simply logs the input string passed into the contract's core function.
